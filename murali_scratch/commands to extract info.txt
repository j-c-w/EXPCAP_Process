# this is to extract timestamps of received packets.
# 10.0.0.26 is client side so only rx packets are shown.
# extract only timestamp and size in bytes
# timestamp is in microseconds, the amount of time between one packet and the next. 
# this there are few packets but not shown due to the dst filter, this is properly accounted for by the ttt flag. 
# for example, packet1, packet2 and packet3 are there. but packet2 is hidden due to dst filter. in this case, time #timestamp retrieved with packet3 is the correct packet3-packet1 timestamp.
# 70 seconds on ~110GB pcap file
